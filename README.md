# PROG_MODL_BIG_DATA
Programming Models for Big Data


## Learning Objectives: 
The goal of this course is to introduce the Spark programming model for processing Big Data for discovering patterns and designing predictive models. Several datasets will be made available for labs and mini projects. A cluster computing platform will be made available through ICDS-ACI.  You will learn to use a python-version of Spark (pyspark), and a machine learning library on Spark (MLlib) to develop scalable data analytic solutions and assess their performance. The learning objectives of the course are the following:

* Gain hands-on experience about programming in Spark that are designed to be scalable for handling Big Data.
* Be able to design and implement scalable machine learning algorithms  using pySpark in a cluster environment.
* Be able to choose Spark program design options and choose Spark configurations in a cluster and assess their performance toward the goal of enhancing their scalability.
